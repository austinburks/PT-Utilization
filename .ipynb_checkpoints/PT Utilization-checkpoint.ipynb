    "<h4> The objective of this notebook is to provide exploratory analysis for PT Utilization benchmarking. There are several goals of this project: </h4>\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Provide a base of historical data on which the benchmarks will be derived.\n",
    "    * This needs to be cut by different member demographic types in order to correctly use historical data\n",
    "    * A concept of seasonality would need to be introduced (Eg, Higher ED product utilization following the school calender)\n",
    "* Understanding how historical trends translate into \"good\" or \"bad\" utilization levels\n",
    "* Product specific utilization metrics will need to treated seperately and will obviously need to be treated at a product level only\n",
    "* Rolling up to product level will be the most macro we anticpate being able to go, as metric types won't be applicable cross product\n",
    "    * That being said, we can roll up certain statistics, such as % of members in x percentile, to the vertical level\n"
