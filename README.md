<h1> PT Utilization Notebook </h1>
<br>
<h3> The objective of this notebook is to provide exploratory analysis for PT Utilization benchmarking. There are several goals of this project: </h3>
    
* Provide a base of historical data on which the benchmarks will be derived.
    * This needs to be cut by different member demographic types in order to correctly use historical data.
    * A concept of seasonality would need to be introduced (Eg, Higher ED product utilization following the school calender)
* Understanding how historical trends translate into "good" or "bad" utilization levels.
* Product specific utilization metrics will need to treated seperately and will obviously need to be treated at a product level only.
* Rolling up benchmarking metrics to the product level will be the most macro we anticpate being able to go. This is because metrics won't be applicable cross product.
    * That being said, we can roll up certain statistics, such as % of members in x percentile, to the vertical level.
